# Subrepo

An experimental clone of git subrepo, to be extended with improvements.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'subrepo'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install subrepo

## Usage

Summary:
```
git subrepo init
git subrepo push
git subrepo pull
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `script/setup` to install dependencies. Then,
run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `script/console` for an
interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
